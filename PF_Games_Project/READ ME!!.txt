Mam To run our games, I am using VS CODE, With Min GW compiler. To compile all files together and run it, follow the following steps: -


+--------------------- At first you don't need to compile anything ----------------------+
Simply type the following command in your terminal

Command =  ./menu


If the program doesn't run do the following steps: -

+-------- First enter the following command in your terminal----------------+
1.  cd {enter here the directory of ur folder where u are running} (e.g /mnt/c/Coding_Files/PF_Games_Project/)
g++ menu.cpp hang_man_HK-NM.cpp tic_tac_toe_AJ.cpp number_guessing_ZH.cpp rock_scissor_RN.cpp pac_man_JZ-AJ.cpp  -o menu

+--------- Run the file using this command in your terminal -------------------+
2. ./menu

3. Enjoy.
