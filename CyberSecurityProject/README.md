## Description

This is my final Project for CS50. It's based on the CyberSecurity, which awares users about different cyber attacks and digital literacy.

### Working

I made three programs to showcase the working of CyberSecurity they are:

#### Password Authorizer

It first provides the user with a basic set of specifications which a good password contains. This program works on the basis of checking a password that user has putted in and rating it's security level wether the password was a **Strong Password, Moderate Password or a Weak Password**. It gives real time recommendation to the user on what they are missing in their password to make it more secure and robust.

> Fun fact the password on your phone right now could be 000000.

#### Phishing Website

This program is basically a phishing website. A phishing website is an apparent fake website which redirects users to input their personal informations and steals their info like their *credit card numbers, or passwords*. This program is a fake google website, on accessing it, it asks the user to input their name and password and if the user inputs it, all the info gets stored into the database and is displayed showcasing their info has been taken from them, and shows all the previous users who fell to this **devious** scam.

> Only the unknowing falls to the plays of the wretched.

#### Update Notifier

This program is based on the scenario that whenever a user logins to their computer they are constantly bombarded by notifications to update their OS, which is quite tedious but it's for our own betterment. It consists of a single login button which when clicked shows up a warning to the user to update their OS, which when clicked redirects the user to the official website of Microsoft to go update their OS.

> Better Safe Then Sorry.

#### Credits

This section contains credits of the web application, it tells what kind of technologies i used e.t.c.

> To know the technology, you must first know yourself.

### Files

My program contains the following files

#### App.py

This is my main flask application which handles all the logic of the programs, and contains all flask code written in python, it handles different case handles for the password checker, phishing website and the update notifier.

#### HTML Files

They contain different html webpages each for different section of web application, and each respective program has their own html file, where as their is one layout file which is inherent on all the other files using jinja syntax

#### CSS Files

It contains two CSS files one of which is the bootstrap css file, and the other is written by me to be subjective to my own needs.

#### Database File

It contains all the data stored in the SQL phishing website.

## This Was CS50

That's all Folks.
